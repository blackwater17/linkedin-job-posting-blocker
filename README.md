## Usage: 

Install a userscript manager extension like Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey or Violentmonkey. Then view the userscript file 
(```job-posting-blocker.user.js```) in GitHub. Click the "Raw" button to view the script. You will be prompted to install it; click "Yes" to proceed with the installation.
With this userscript you will be able to block job postings from any companies you choose. Under the job postings there will be a custom block button and when clicked you will no longer see job postings by that company.

Later on if you want to remove the block for certain company, you will need to clear your browser cache. If you are familiar with web development you can go to ```localStorage > blocked_companies``` and remove the company you want from there manually.
This feature has not been implemented in the UI yet.
